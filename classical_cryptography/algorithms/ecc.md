# ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that relies on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides the same level of security as RSA but with smaller key sizes, making it more efficient.

## How ECC Works

### Key Generation

1. **Elliptic Curve Selection**:
   - Choose an elliptic curve \( E \) defined over a finite field \( \mathbb{F}_p \), where \( p \) is a prime number.
   - Select a base point \( G \) on the curve.

2. **Private Key**:
   - Choose a random integer \( d \) from the interval \([1, n-1]\), where \( n \) is the order of the base point \( G \).

3. **Public Key**:
   - Compute the public key \( Q = dG \), where \( d \) is the private key and \( G \) is the base point.

### Encryption and Decryption

1. **Encryption**:
   - Convert the plaintext message \( M \) to a point \( P \) on the elliptic curve.
   - Choose a random integer \( k \) from the interval \([1, n-1]\).
   - Compute the ciphertext as a pair of points \( (C_1, C_2) \), where \( C_1 = kG \) and \( C_2 = P + kQ \).

2. **Decryption**:
   - Compute the original message point \( P \) using the private key \( d \): \( P = C_2 - dC_1 \).

## Security

The security of ECC is based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is computationally hard to solve. ECC provides strong security with shorter key lengths compared to RSA.

## Applications

- **Secure Communications**: ECC is widely used in secure messaging protocols like Signal and WhatsApp.
- **Digital Signatures**: Used in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).
- **Key Exchange**: ECC-based key exchange mechanisms are used in TLS and other secure communication protocols.
