# Classical Cryptography

Classical cryptography is based on mathematical problems that are difficult to solve using current computational power. The most well-known algorithms include RSA, AES, and ECC.

## Principles of Classical Cryptography

1. **Symmetric Algorithms**: Use the same key for both encryption and decryption of data (e.g., AES).
2. **Asymmetric Algorithms**: Use a pair of keys â€” a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA).

## Security

The security of classical cryptography relies on the complexity of mathematical problems such as factoring large numbers or computing discrete logarithms. However, the advent of quantum computing poses a potential threat to the security of many classical algorithms.

## Applications

Classical cryptography is widely used in various applications including secure communications, digital signatures, and data protection. It is integral to many modern technologies and standards.

## Common Algorithms

- **RSA**: Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers.
- **AES**: A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data.
- **ECC**: Uses the properties of elliptic curves to provide security with smaller key sizes.
