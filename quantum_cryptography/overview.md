# Quantum Cryptography

Quantum cryptography leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to secure data. The most well-known example is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).

## Principles of Quantum Cryptography

1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: Any attempt to measure a quantum state disturbs it, allowing the detection of eavesdropping.
2. **Quantum Superposition**: Enables the creation of quantum states that cannot be duplicated.

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD allows two parties to generate a shared secret key that is secure against any computational attack. The security is based on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than computational complexity.

### How QKD Works

1. **Preparation and Transmission**:
   - Alice prepares a sequence of photons in random quantum states and sends them to Bob.
   - Each photon can be in one of four possible states (e.g., horizontal, vertical, diagonal, anti-diagonal).

2. **Measurement**:
   - Bob measures each photon using a random basis (either rectilinear or diagonal).
   - Due to the principles of quantum mechanics, Bob's measurements will be correct about 50% of the time.

3. **Key Sifting**:
   - Alice and Bob publicly compare a subset of their measurement results to detect any eavesdropping.
   - If the error rate is below a certain threshold, they proceed to generate the key from the remaining bits.

4. **Error Correction and Privacy Amplification**:
   - Alice and Bob use classical communication to correct any errors in the key.
   - They apply privacy amplification to reduce the information an eavesdropper might have obtained.

## Security

Quantum cryptography offers unconditional security based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It is immune to attacks from quantum computers.

## Applications

- **Secure Communications**: QKD is used in secure communication networks.
- **Government and Military**: Ensures the confidentiality of sensitive information.
- **Financial Services**: Protects transactions and financial data.
