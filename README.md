# Comparison of Classical and Quantum Cryptography

This project aims to compare classical and quantum cryptography. We will examine the basic principles, algorithms, protocols, security, and applications of these technologies.

## Project Structure

- `classical_cryptography/`: Materials on classical cryptography.
- `quantum_cryptography/`: Materials on quantum cryptography.
- `comparison.md`: Comparison of classical and quantum cryptography.

## Goals

1. Understand the fundamental differences between classical and quantum cryptography.
2. Analyze the security implications of each approach.
3. Explore the practical applications and future potential of quantum cryptography.
